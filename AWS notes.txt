GOOD TO KNOW: 
If you upgrade instance type create a new image backup. Ask GPT.

If randomly stopped responding, check public ip address of ec2 instance. Sometimes randomly changes. 

If so, need to add new public ip address to ALLOWED_HOST in settings.py
Also add A RECORD In name cheap with the new public ip address.
